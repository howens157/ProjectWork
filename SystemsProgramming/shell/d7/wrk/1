Max Uhle and John Merriam conducted the first excavation of the site in 1902. At the time, the enormous site was the central feature of "Shellmound Park." As part of a recreation ground, the Emeryville mound was crowned with a dance pavilion and cypress hedge. With the pavilion atop the center of the mound, Uhle and Merriam excavated a lateral section of the mound's western slope and a tunnel that extended from there to its center.

As the cave grew, the roof of the shaft became unstable and collapsed, forming a rather vertical shaft open at ground level (Muldoon et al. 2009). The bottom of the shaft opens into a large room with a sloping floor, which continues to the known end of the cave, approximately 230 m vertical distance below the entrance. At the base of the shaft and in lower areas of the cave, considerable quantities of terrestrial animal bones were found.	vertebrate

The terrace holds the stratified archaeological materials described here. The rock cliffs along the shoreline are partially formed by white marble, leading to this place being named Sagan-Zaba, or “white bowl,” in the local Buriat dialect. The vertical cliff at the southwest end of the cove holds a large panel of rock art (Sagan-Zaba I) with images of humans, deer, birds, and riders on horseback.

Discovered during construction of the Hotel Bali Hai, the site straddles the boundary between Vaito' otia and Fa'ahia, two traditional land districts on Huahine (Sinoto 1988: Figure 1). The site, therefore, has been called by both names, depending on which side of the boundary a given excavation occurs. Thus the name Vaito' otia (site ScH1-1) was used by Sinoto and McCoy (1975) and Bellwood (1979: 310,324), while the name Fa'ahia (site ScH1-2) was used by Pigeot (1985, 1986). Both names were used by Emory (1979) and Sinoto (1979, 1983, 1988). Even though initial excavations were in the Vaito' otia district and later excavations were in Fa' ahia, less than 100 m separates the two excavated areas (Figure 4). Only a single, large site is represented, regardless of its name. For convenience, we refer to the site as Fa'ahia, thereby conforming to more recent usage.	vertebrate

W. E. Schenck salvaged a large series of human burials and associated artifacts, along with a large collection of vertebrate materials, as the mound was being demolished. Unfortunately, Schenck was unable to collect within-site provenience data for the vertebrate bones and teeth collected at that time, because "scientific ends were secondary" (Schenck 1926). However, after the mound had been\r\nreduced to the level of the surrounding plain, Schenck excavated three 50 x 6 ft trenches in the base of the deposit, near the center of the mound. Those trenches, excavated in 1-ft arbitrary levels to a depth of >10 ft, produced a sizable faunal collection (Schenck 1926).	vertebrate
