# Systems Programming - Daily 1

The purpose of this assignment is to practice using the shell.  You will need to log into a remote shell, navigate to the homework directory, read a file (this one!), and answer a few basic questions.

## The Questions

1) What are the four main parts of an operating system?  Give a one sentence description of each.
    
    The first part is the Kernel, which manages access to the hardware.
    The second part is the Driver, which helps the Kernel to understand how to use the hardware.
    The third part is the user programs, which are the programs that are actually run on the hardware.
    The fourth part is the shell, which is the outermost layer of the operating system that a user would normally interact with.

2) What was the key motivation for making the Unix operating system?

    The key motivation was to allow many different users to use one computer without having to give each user full access to the entirety of the computer hardware.

3) When you "ssh to student01" and type "date", why might the time differ between what is printed on the shell and what is printed on your computer's GUI clock?

   When interacting at the shell level, you are interacting with the hardware one level deeper than the when using the GUI. Because of this, it takes less time to fetch and display the time. This could cause a very slight difference in the time that is displayed. 

## Grading

This assignment is worth just one point.  I will give full credit for any reasonable answers, and correct any "completely wrong" answers via email or in the next lecture.
