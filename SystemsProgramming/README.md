# Systems Programming
This folder contains project work for my Systems Programming course.

The course is divided into 3 units:
- Bash Scripts
- Python
- C

The daily assignments (d1, d2, etc.) are smaller scale assignments to practice a particular concept.

The milestone projects for each unit (m1a, m1b, m2a, etc.) are larger scale projects that encapsulate the whole unit to which they correspond.
