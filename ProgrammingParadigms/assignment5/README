Programming Paradigms Assignment 5

I think that I got everything working except for the timing of the sorting algorithms.
I tried to implement timing them by having a time attribute of the Sorter abstract class
but I had a lot of issues with accessing and updating the time value which I believe is
due to some confusion on how self is used in Python. For example, when I call the Sorter
functions from the DataSet class, it requires me to pass a value for self. For example,
if the function prototype is def sort(self, data), when I call the function it requires
me to pass two arguments whereas I thought that you did not pass anything for self. I 
am not sure where this error is coming from, but regardless, my other functions were
still able to work but when I tried to add the timing everything started to break so I 
did not include it.
