Assignment 2

In my version of Pong, I randomized the color of the ball every time it hit one of the
paddles or a goal was scored. I also controlled the opposing paddle by making it slowly
move toward the ball, moving up if the ball was above the paddle, and down if the ball
was below it. However, it only moves when the ball is on its side of the field, in order
to make it a little easier for the user to score. I also gave the user a little more
control in how they hit the ball back by calculating the angle the ball is hit back at
based on where the user hits the ball with the paddle. For example, if the ball hits the
paddle in the center, it should bounce toward the opposing side in a horizontal line.
The further away from the center the ball hits, the more extreme the angle becomes.
Finally, I allowed the user to end the game early by pressing E.
