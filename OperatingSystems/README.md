# Operating Systems

This folder contains project work for my Operating Systems course.
#
Project 1 is a c implementation of a file or directory copy.
#
Project 2 is a custom shell that allows the user to perform basic functions like listing the contents of their directory, changing their working directory, copying files, and executing other programs.
#
Project 3 is an exercise in multithreading that calculates and displays portions of the Mandelbrot set. The user can explore the fractal, moving and zooming in and out.
