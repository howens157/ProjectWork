From the user's perspective, the program will output the options for that the user can 
choose from. The user will be prompted for an int between 0 and 7 to choose an what 
analysis to perform on the data (1-7) or quit the program (0). If the user inputs any 
other int, the program will display an error message and repeat the prompt. The program 
will then ask the user for any additional information if necessary and output the results. 
Finally, the programwill display the original prompt again and repeat this process
until the user enters 0 to quit the program.

Internally, the program consists of a very top level main(), prompt() to prompt the
user to choose an operation, and a function for each of the options available. prompt()
asks the user to enter a number to choose an option from the list and returns that number 
as an int. record() prompts the user for a year, and outputs the record for that year.
minWins() and minLosses() prompt the user for a minimum number of wins/losses and 
loop through the full arrays and prints all the years with a number of wins/losses at 
or above that number. losingRecs() and winningRecs() print out all of the seasons with a 
losing or winning record, respectively. losingStreaks() and winningStreaks() prompt the
user for streak length and then loop through the entire arrays keeping track of the current
length of the losing/winning streak. In every loop, it checks if the streak is over by
premptively checking the next year and checks if the streak length is above the length
input by the user. If both of these conditions are met, the streak is output to the user.

I verified the results were correct by comparing the results output by the program to 
the wikipedia page that the wins and losses were taken from.
