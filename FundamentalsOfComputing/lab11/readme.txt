Mini Final Project readme

I made a simplified version of Tetris for my project. It is simplified in the sense that there is no way to
store a piece to use later and there are no rules for how to handle rotations that would cause the piece
to overlap with the walls or another piece. The rotation just fails in this case. Additionally, the points system is
simplified. The game does not speed up over time and the score is based solely on clearing lines from the board.

Controls:
Move the piece left right and down with A,S,D.
Rotate the piece with spacebar
Press Z to slam the piece down instantly
Press Q to quit the game
