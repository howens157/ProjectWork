My program from part 3 is meant to calculate the current value of a bank account that
accumulates interest based on the compound interest formula. From the user's perspective,
they will run the program and then be prompted to enter the initial principal of the
account, the interest rate as a decimal, the number of years that interest accumulates,
and the number of times pe year that interest is compounded. These inputs will be executed
in four separate lines. Then, the program will output the new total of the bank account.

From the programmer's perspective, the program has three main sections. First, all of the
variables that will be used in the program are declared. Second, the program prompts the
user to input the needed variables and assigns their values accordingly. Third and finally,
the program will calculate the value of the account based on the compound interest formula
and will assign that value to the "total" variable, and output the result.

I evaluated the program for correctness by comparing the result to the answer I got when
calculating the value of the account by hand. The only cases in which it should produce
incorrect results is if the user inputs invalid entries for the variables as we were not
checked to verify the inputs in the program. If the type of the input is wrong, or if
the user inputs something that does not make logical sense, such as inputting a string
for the initial principal or inputting a negative number for the interest rate, the 
program may not run or may not output an answer that makes sense.
