For funanim.c the user can control the direction and rotation using 'a' and 'd'.
'd' will increase the rotation in the clockwise direction. 'a' will increase the 
rotation in the counterclockwise direction. Clicking in the window will flip the
rotation of the image. The user can also control what polygons are used to create
the image by pressing the numbers 3-9. For whichever number is pressed, the image
will consist of polygons with 3 through that number sides. For example, if 3 is
pressed, only a triangle will be drawn. If 6 is pressed, a triangle, square, 
pentagon, and hexagon will be drawn.
