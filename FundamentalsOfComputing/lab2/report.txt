Lab 2 Report

For part 3 of the lab, graph.c is programmed to generate an ASCII Art graph of a mathematical
function. In my program I chose the function 20 + 8*sin(x)/(x/5) over the range 0.2 to 20.
It also finds the maximum and minimum over that range.

From the user's perspective, the user is not required to do anything. The user just runs the
program and the graph will be created and the max and min displayed at the bottom of the graph.

Internally, the program first declares all the variables it will use. Then prints the header of the
graph. Next, the max and min variables are assigned the first values of the graph as the inital
value to be checked against. Next, the graph is created with a for loop from from i = 1 to 100.
i is multiplied by 0.2 every time to get the range 0.2 to 20 without losing precision. For every
loop, Y is calculated and then a corresponding number of '>' characters are printed to create
the graph. Also in the loop, every Y value is checked against the current min and max. If it is
determined to be the new min or max, the value of min or max is updated to be the current Y value
and the value of locMin or locMax are updated to be the current X value. Finally, after the graph
is complete, the maximum, minimum, and their locations are printed to the user.

The graph and max/min were verified to be correct through the use of WolframAlpha. I put the same
equation into WolframAlpha and got the same graph. Additionally, it calculated the local maxima
and minima which were the same as well, aside from some slight loss of precision due to the 
program only calculating at every interval of 0.2.
