From the user's perspective, the program will output the options for the operators
that the user can choose from. The user will be prompted for an int between 1 and 5
to choose an operator (1-4) or quit the program (5). If the user inputs any other int,
the program will display an error message and repeat the prompt. The program will then
ask the user for two numbers and perform the chosen operation on the two inputs.
Finally, the program will display the original prompt again and repeat this process
until the user enters 5 to quit the program.

Internally, the program consists of a very top level main(), prompt() to prompt the
user to choose an operation, and a function for each of the four operations. prompt()
asks the user to enter a number to choose an operation and returns that number as an
int. Each of the four operator functions prompts the user for two numbers and then
performs that function's respective operation on the inputs and displays the results.
In main(), first int choice is declared to hold the user's choice. Then a while loop 
begins with while(1) so that the loop will continue to run until the user chooses 5.
In the loop, first prompt() is called and the user's choice is assigned to choice.
Then, a switch statement is used to call the correct operator function in accordance
with the user's choice. If the user enters 5, an error message is displayed and then
there is a return statement to quit the program. The default case is to print an error
message and reprompt the user.

I verified that the output of the the program is correct by testing each of the cases
and comparing the results to the results of the same calculations on my graphing 
calculator.
